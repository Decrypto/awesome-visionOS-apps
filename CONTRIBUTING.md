# Contribution Guidelines

The goal of this list is to crowdsource awesome visionOS apps.

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Only include apps optimized for visionOS, no "Designed for iPad" apps.
- Only submit shipping products, not sample code.
- Use the following format: `[APP NAME](LINK) - DESCRIPTION.`
- End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Ensure links provide sufficient details about the app, including how it's native to visionOS.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep the list alphabetical in each category.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestions!
